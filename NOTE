  content: '<!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Ibrahim Abdullahi, the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has stated that the upcoming political landscape for the 2027 elections will feature the All Progressives Congress (APC) facing off against the Nigerian populace, rather than the PDP. This shift comes in the wake of recent defections from the PDP to the APC.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n' +

    '<!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Abdullahi characterized the defections as acts motivated by greed and self-interest, emphasizing that these actions would not deter the PDP from its mission to rebuild the nation. He referenced the recent resignation of Bayelsa State Governor Duoye Diri, asserting that there was no valid justification for governors elected under the PDP banner to abandon the party.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n' +

    '<!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Abdullahi stated, "As we approach 2027, the contest is no longer between the PDP and APC; it is now the APC versus the people of Nigeria. The defections are driven by nothing more than greed, avarice, and selfishness. From my perspective and that of other Nigerians, there is no compelling reason for a governor completing a second term, such as in Bayelsa, to leave the party."</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n' +

    '<!-- wp:paragraph --><p>He added, "For the PDP, it is a case of good riddance to bad rubbish. If we can eliminate these elements before our convention next month, we will emerge more cohesive and better prepared to rescue this country from what we consider an occupying force masquerading as a democratic government."</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n' +

    "<!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The PDP spokesperson also expressed concern about the nation's condition under the APC administration, noting that Nigerians have endured significant hardships over the past decade, particularly in the last two years.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->"
